About word predictor

Based on the last n entered words, use the text in file.txt to predict the next word. Initially n=2 (current can't change n value in GUI)

How to use:
  - Put sample text file in file.txt. Word prediction will be based on text in this file
  - Run main.py. You will see a GUI with a textbox and a button that says "generate text"
  - Enter some words and click "generate text". You will see a list of predicted next word and the possibility for each of them.
  - If the last n words you entered does not appear consecutively in file.txt, the program is unable to predict the next word. Therefore, more text you have in file.txt, better the prediction will be.
